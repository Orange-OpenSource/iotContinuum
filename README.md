## Why IoT Continuum

With IoT Continuum, gain in efficiency by capitalizing on everything that has been achieved in your project's previous development cycles.
Thus, the components and the design used from the start-up phase (PoC â€“ Proof of Concept) are scalable and compatible with the industrial deployment phase. A new design will therefore no longer be necessary either during the next phase of Proof Of Value (convincing) or in the final phase of deployment and industrial scale-up.

This development kit is provided by IoT Continuum to developers who are willing to start from scratch with a development kit approved by IoT Continuum.

## Arduino IDE or STM32 Cube IDE?

2 Getting Started experiences are provided: one using the Arduino IDE (simpler) and the other one using the STM32 Cube IDE (recommended for proper engineering).

If you are discovering this development kit and are not familiar with STM32 Cube environment, we recommend you to [get started with the Arduino IDE](Arduino/). Otherwise, the [STM32 Cube IDE](STM32Cube/) is the recommended way, especially because of its debug capabilities that are not available on Arduino environment.
